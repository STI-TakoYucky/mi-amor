                <p>Na Jaemin, my emotional lifeline and energy booster. He inspires me the most because of his
                    advocacies. Jaemin and his dedication in doing the things he wants is such a motivation. I am
                    gaining a lot of strength because of him and his positive mindset. Everything about him persuades me
                    to continue living her life. He holds a special place in my heart.</p>

                <h1 class="header1 ">Cristina Yang</h1>
                <p>Proceed to my favorite story in alternate universe entitled "Baliktanaw". The story is inspired by the series Grey's Anatomy and I'm drunk, I love you. The plot revolves around the concept of learning to choose yourself. Because of the overall story, this story has a significant impact on me. It's filled with life lessons.

                    Grey's Anatomy... Cristina Yang. Cristina Yang is a brilliant, ambitious woman who is determined to succeed. She's also extremely competitive and has a no-nonsense personality trait.
                    
                    When I first started watching Grey's Anatomy, Cristina Yang inspired me. Because of that, I always wanted to be a neuro/cardiosurgeon. </p>
