                <h1>Na Jaemin</h1>
                <p>Na Jaemin, my emotional lifeline and energy booster. He inspires me the most because of his
                    advocacies. Jaemin and his dedication in doing the things he wants is such a motivation. I am
                    gaining a lot of strength because of him and his positive mindset. Everything about him persuades me
                    to continue living her life. He holds a special place in my heart.</p>
